"""Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. It is commonly used in various optimization problems, 
including in the field of quantum chemistry. The goal of Gradient Descent is to iteratively update a solution or parameter vector by taking steps 
proportional to the negative gradient of the function being minimized.

Here's how Gradient Descent works:

1. Initialization: Start with an initial guess for the solution or parameter vector.

2. Compute the Gradient: Evaluate the gradient of the objective function with respect to the solution vector. 
            The gradient represents the direction of steepest ascent, pointing towards the direction of the maximum increase of the function.

3. Update the Solution: Update the solution vector by taking a step in the direction opposite to the gradient. This step is proportional to the negative gradient 
            and is determined by a learning rate or step size parameter. The learning rate controls the size of the step taken at each iteration.

4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3: Compute the gradient at the updated solution and repeat the process until a stopping criterion is met. 
            The stopping criterion can be a maximum number of iterations, reaching a desired level of convergence, or other predefined conditions.

The key idea behind Gradient Descent is that by iteratively moving in the direction of the negative gradient, the algorithm can gradually approach the minimum of the function.
 The learning rate determines the step size, and a suitable learning rate is important to ensure convergence. If the learning rate is too large, 
 the algorithm may overshoot the minimum and fail to converge. If the learning rate is too small, the algorithm may converge slowly.

Gradient Descent can be used for both convex and non-convex optimization problems. However, it may get stuck in local minima for non-convex functions,
 and there are variants of Gradient Descent that are designed to address this limitation, such as stochastic gradient descent and momentum-based methods.

Overall, Gradient Descent is a widely used and fundamental optimization algorithm that can efficiently minimize objective functions by iteratively updating
the solution vector based on the negative gradient."""
